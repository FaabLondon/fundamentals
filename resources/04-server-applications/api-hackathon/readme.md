# API Hackathon

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This Lab is meant to be done as a group activity, the groups should be created by the instructor._

**Explore third-party APIs** that you haven't had time to use and extend your skillset by make something super cool in a short period of time. We've spent some time building our own APIs and now, using someone else's will help you see how powerful APIs can be.

You are welcome to use any API you'd like - look below for some suggestions. One useful tool for inspecting API responses you aren't yet familiar with is [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/), which may come in handy if you need it.

Try to push yourself beyond just authentication for the social APIs, see how you can really make use of the API's features, and build *whatever* you want!

We'll compete for `Coolest Project Award` for whichever team builds the most useful, interesting, or fun apps on top of third-party APIs. Use whichever tools you like that we've learned so far together, your choice.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Build a Sinatra, Rails, or even a command line app that implements at least one API
