As in the previous exercise, your job is to print the result of an expression. However, this time your expressions will need to depend on the variable `x`.

1) Write an expression that evaluates to 10 more than `x`;<br>
   if `x` is 10, the expression should evaluate to 20;<br>
   if `x` is 50, the expression should evaluate to 60.<br>
   Test your answer by replacing the `/* Your Expression */` comment in the JavaScript tab with `x = someValue;`, clicking the "Run" button, writing your expression in the console tab, and typing `enter` or `return`.

2) Now, replace that first expression with an expression that evaluates to triple the value of `x` plus 5;<br>
   if `x` is 5, the expression should evaluate to 20;<br>
   if `x` is 10, the expression should evaluate to 35.<br>
   What happens if you set `x` to 100? Does the expression work like you'd expect?

3) Next, replace that expression with one that evaluates to "Hello, x.";<br>
   if `x` is "Alice," the expression should evaluate to "Hello, Alice.";<br>
   if `x` is "Bob," the expression should evaluate to "Hello, Bob.".

4) Finally, replace the prior expression with one that evaluates to "Goodbye, x.";<br>
   if `x` is "Charlene," the expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, Charlene.";<br>
   if `x` is "David," the expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, David".

Try out all of the different "test cases" mentioned above.
If they all give you the answers you expected, you're done!
