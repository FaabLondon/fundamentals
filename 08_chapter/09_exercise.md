You should see the following code in the editor window:

```javascript
var x;
/* Your Expression */
```

If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

1) Write an expression that assigns `x` to the variable `value`, so long as `x` is not `undefined` or `null`;
if `x` is `undefined` or `null`, the expression should set `value` to 100.
`x` is equal to `undefined` when no value has been assigned (e.g., `var x;`), but you could also assign it the value of `null` (`var x = null;`), and both of these values would be "falsey."
After you click the "Run" button, you can test this in the console tab by typing `value`, and then `enter` or `return`. Test your expression for several different values of `x`, including `null`. does it behave like you expect?

2) Next, replace that expression with one that assigns `null` to `value` if `x` is `null` or `undefined`, but otherwise assigns 50 (regardless of `x`'s actual value).

3) Finally, write an expression that assigns `true` to `value` if `x` is an empty string (`''`) but otherwise assigns `false`.

Were you able to get all of your expressions to work? If so, nice job!
