# Web Page Layout

Now that we've learned about layout, we're even better equipped to format our HTML and uniquely style our memory game!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

The current state of your game could use some formatting and personalization.
* To give your web page a personal touch, add a footer with some personalized text. Perhaps something like, `Created with love by <your name>`.
* Figure out a way to throw in an icon as well, and make your name a different color than the rest of the text to give it some oomph.
* Last but surely not least, give your page a nice touch by centering all of its text.

##### Below are the steps for completing this assignment:

1) Create your footer with the following text and a heart icon underneath your `div`s, before your closing body tag.

*Created with &hearts; by GA*

2) Wrap the words "GA" using `span` tags, and give it a class of "name" so you can style it.

3) Go into `style.css`, and color your name with #ff0000.

4) Finally, center the text in the body selector using the `text-align` property.


#### Deliverable

Nice â€” things are looking better already!
