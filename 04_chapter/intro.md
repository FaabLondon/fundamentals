#Layout Basics

At this point in our journey with HTML and CSS, we'll want to start moving things around on our web page. But before we do that, we need to understand that HTML elements function and behave differently within a web browser. They can either be inline or block elements. What's the difference? Is a heading tag an inline or a block element? When CSS is applied, how will it render in the browser? These are all questions we'll explore in the video below.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/5jz9br5kiz?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

#### Checkpoint:

* Which of these are inline elements? Block elements?

  * `<a>`
  * `<p>`
  * `<img>`
  * `<strong>`
  * `<h3>`
  * `<ul>`
