In this exercise, we'll take some time to play around with **divs**, **spans**, **margins**, and **padding** to create a text layout.

Here's what the content will look like when you're finished styling. Fancy!

If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

We won't touch this HTML, but take a look at it before you hop over to the CSS tab. To give yourself more space, you can select the CSS and Output tabs. Also, we've provided you with the `p` style.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/likihi/embed?html,css,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

1) Set the `body`'s background to #333 and the `div`'s background to #c0dec5.

2) Add a margin of 4em on *all four sides* of the `div`'s content (outside of the pale blue box).

3) Set the `div`'s top padding to 2em, the right padding to 3em, the bottom padding to 0, and the left padding to 3em.

4) Give the `span` three property-value pairs: a `font-variant` of small-caps, a `font-family` of Tahoma, sans-serif, and `letter-spacing` of .25em.

5) Set the `span`'s padding to "0 .2em" and its background color to "rgb(100,150,150)."

6) On second thought, that color looks a little dark. Let's practice with RGB and alpha, and make it 50% translucent. Change the `span`'s background color from RGB to rgba, and add a .5 alpha.

7) In your HTML, the second `p` tag has a class attribute named "right." Let's right-align that paragraph! Add the new style to your CSS.


Fabulous! You just rocked it on a bunch of topics that can stump even professional web designers.
