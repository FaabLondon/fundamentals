**WDI Fundamentals Unit 2**

> **NOTE** Moving forward, we'll be labeling HTML tags and relevant code in the `following format` (e.g., `p` for a paragraph tag or element).

##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Time to give it a go! In this exercise, you'll get some practice opening and closing your first HTML tags.

Your output should look like this:

### Instructions
If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

Type your answers directly into the text editor. Click the **Output** button at the top of the editor to see how your HTML code renders.

1) Let's start with some content! Type the text below into your editor.

```
My first website!
By a talented student
Built with WDI at GA.
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/xuhubej/embed?html&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.37.0"></script>

2) Next, open a *level one heading tag* (`h1`) at the very beginning where it says "My first website!"

3) Did you notice that all the content was set to `h1`? Aha! That's because you still need to close the tag, which tells the browser when to stop rendering the text as a heading. Go ahead and close the heading tag now.

4) Open and close a *level two heading tag* (`h2`) on the second line, which reads "By a talented student."

5) Lastly, wrap this sentence in a *paragraph tag* (`p`): "Built with WDI at GA."

#### Checkpoint

Make sure you have:
- Opened and closed `h1` tags around the site's name.
- Opened and closed `h2` tags around the site's subheading.
- Opened and closed `p` tags around the site's body content.


You've just built a website with HTML! Sure, it's pretty basic right now, but you're just getting started.
