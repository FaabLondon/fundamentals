#Text Editors and Browsers

There are two main tools for writing code: web browsers and stand-alone text editors.

During your admissions assessment, you completed your programming exercises in Dash and CodePen. Those applications asked you to write code using a web-based text editor. In other words, they asked you to write your code within your web browser. During Fundamentals, you'll use another web-based text editor called JS Bin to work through unit exercises. But, for your unit assignments, you'll need to write your code in a stand-alone text editor.

We'll use text editors and web browsers to build web applications in class and - more importantly - on the job. Watch the video below to learn more about these two essential tools.
