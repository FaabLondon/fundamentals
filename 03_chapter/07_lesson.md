#### Linking our Files

We've already learnd a lot about HTML and CSS. But how does a CSS file communicate with an HTML file? In order for an HTML file to pull in the proper CSS file, you're going to have link the two! Let's find out how.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/6nenlcostv?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>


>**Note** **Relative vs. Absolute Addressing**: A relative address/path is one that's defined with respect to your own position within a file system (e.g., `./index.html`, `main.css`). An absolute address/path is one defined with respect to some fixed location within a file system (e.g., `/` or `~`).

A good rule of thumb to remember is that an absolute path always points to the same place, no matter where *you* might be in your file system.


#### Checkpoint:

* What are some best practices for organizing my files and folders on my computer? Should I be saving my work elsewhere?
* What is the common name for primary CSS pages?
* Where in the HTML boilerplate would you put the `link` element?
* What do `rel`, `type`, and `href` describe?
* Where does 'text/css' go in the 'link' attribute?
