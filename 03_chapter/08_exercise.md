Now it's time to work with images. Our goal in this exercise will be to use HTML `img` tags to put an image on a web page.

#### Instructions
If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

1) Take a look at this starter code. Yep, it's your HTML boilerplate!

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/jemeyex/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.11"></script>

2) Write in an `img` tag between the `body` tags.

3) Add `src="http://i.imgur.com/z9gGd0t.jpg"` to your `img` tag (Grumpy Cat has strong opinions about visual design!).

4) Add `alt="grumpy cat hates bad design"` to your `img` tag.

5) Add `title="grumpy cat"` to your `img` tag.


#### Important to Remember

* Image elements are self-closing; they don't need a closing tag.
* Image URLs must end with an image extension, usually `.jpg`, `.gif`, or `.png`.
* Images require an `src` attribute. Including `title` and `alt` is also strongly recommended.

*Think about all the awesome stuff you can build online using images! Are you excited yet?*
