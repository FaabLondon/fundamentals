# Introduction to HTML Homework

In this unit we've already introduced some of the core fundamentals of web development including how the internet works and how a website is structured and styled. With this newfound knowledge we can go ahead create foundation of our memory card game app. The goal of this exercise is to build a the structure of our website that hosts the memory card game.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* Personalize your website by displaying the name of the game in its corresponding browser tab and the name of your game as a header.
* Also, what good is a game if you don't know how to play? Under your header, include a subheader, "Instructions," and a section explaining how a memory card game is played.

##### Below are the steps to complete the assignment.

1) Open up Sublime Text Editor.

2) Create a new file called index.html

3) Set up the your HTML boilerplate code.

2) Add a `title` element so the name of the game shows in the browser tab.

3) Create a level one heading tags and add in the name of the game within those tags. In this case, the name should be "Memory Game."

4) Add in a level two heading tag that says "Instructions."

5) Type in the text below your level two heading tag in between paragraph tags.

*Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.*

* Add some flare to the site by adding at least two colors! Add some paint to the canvas! For now, we'll use the CSS property `color` to give some spice to the headers. Add the color *teal* to your h1 tag.

* Add the color *gold* to your h2 tags.

>**NOTE** To add styling within your HTML file add your CSS between `<style></style>` tags.

#### Bonus
* Add a subheading describing the game

* Add some personal social media links so users can learn about the developer behind the game.
