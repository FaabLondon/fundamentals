Time to give it a whirl! In this exercise you'll be getting some practice opening and closing your first HTML tags.

### Instructions

Type your answers directly into the text editor below. Click the **Output** button at the top of the editor to see how your html code renders.

1 . Let's start with some content! Type the text below into your editor.

```
My first website!
by a talented student
Built with WDI at GA.
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/zevojec/embed?html&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.11"></script>

2 .  Go ahead and open a *level one heading tag* at the very beginning where it says "My first website!"

3 . You'll notice that everything was set to h1 when you opened the level one heading tag! Ah ha! You still need to close the tag to tell the browser where to stop rendering as a heading. Go ahead and close the heading tag.

4 .Open and close *second-level heading* on the second line "by a talented student."

5 . And lastly, wrap the sentence "Built with WDI at GA." in a paragraph tag.

#### Checkpoint

Make sure you have:
- Opened and closed h1 tags around the site's name.
- Opened and closed h2 tags around the site's subheading.
- Opened and closed p tags around the site's body content.


Sweet! You just built a website with HTML. It's pretty basic, but you are on your way!
