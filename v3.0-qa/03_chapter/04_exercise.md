In this exercise we'll take some time to play around with **divs**, **spans**, **margin**, and **padding** to create a lovely text layout .

Here's what the content will look like when you're finished styling it.Fancy!

We won't touch the HTML, but take a look at it before you hop over to the CSS tab. We gave you the p style. You're welcome!

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/likihi/embed?html,css,output&height=600px"> on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.11"></script>

1 . Set the body's background to #333 and the div's background to #c0dec5.

2 . Add a margin of 4em on *all four sides* of the div;s content (outside of the pale blue box).

3 . Set the div's padding to 2em 3em 0 3em. That's a top padding of 2em, a right padding of 3em, no padding on the bottom, and 3em on the left.

4 .Give the span three property-value pairs: a font-variant of small-caps, a font-family of tahoma, sans-serif and .25em of letter-spacing.

5 . Set the span's padding to 0 .2em. Set its background color to rgb(100,150,150).

6 . Actually, that color is a little dark. Let's practice with rgb and alpha, and make it 50% translucent. Change the span's background color from rgb(100,150,150) to rgba(100,150,150,.5).

7 . In your HTML, the second p tag has a class attribute named "right" Let's right-align that paragraph!Add a new style to your CSS. It looks like:

` .right { text-align: right; } `

Fabulous! You just rocked on a bunch of topics that can stump even professional web designers.
