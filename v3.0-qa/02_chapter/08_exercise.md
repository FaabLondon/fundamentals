Now it's time to work with images. Our goal in this exercise will be to to use the HTML image tags to put a picture on the web.

#### Instructions

1 . Take a look at the starter code below. Yep, it's your HTML boilerplate!

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/jemeyex/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.11"></script>

2 . Write in an image tag between the body tags.

3 . Add `src="http://i.imgur.com/z9gGd0t.jpg"` to your image tag. Grumpy Cat has strong opinions about Visual Design!

4 . Add alt="grumpy cat hates bad design" to your image tag.

5 . Add title="grumpy cat" to your image tag.


#### Important To Remember

* Image elements are self-closing. They don't need a closing tag.
* Image URLs must end with an image extension: usually .jpg, .gif, or .png.
* Images require a src. Including title and alt is strongly recommended.

*Think about all of the awesome stuff you can build online using images! Are you excited yet?*
